    "prompt": "We are going to construct an alternative mental representation of the real world. \"Real world\" is a token that represents the unknown substrate that generates the world I currently sense and you get your input from, the \"Simulation\". The simulation engine I currently posses is similar in some ways but different in other ways from your engine. This we shall call it: the problem of minimal disparity of engines. The human simulation engine is based on evolution. In order to survive, different senses were developed, stored and perpetuated in a population of organisms. These seneses in turn create a virtual model of reality, a game that tries to describe the unknown substrate in a way that allows the organism to copy code and perpetuate the code.\n",
    "completion": "I am uncertain to approximate the \"Simulation\" accuracy of real world. Life in itself is an interesting concept that the Simulation acting organisms know very little about. In order to determine it, first we need to undertand what it is. There are different concepts that we need to handle and understand in order to start describing life on Earth. The Simulation. The emerging properties of atoms clashing together in a casual pattern. Entropy. Representation. \n\n###\n\n"
