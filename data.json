      "prompt": "We are going to construct an alternative mental representation of the real world. \"Real world\" is a token that represents the unknown substrate that generates the world I currently sense and you get your input from, the \"Simulation\". The simulation engine I currently posses is similar in some ways but different in other ways from your engine. This we shall call it: the problem of minimal disparity of engines. The human simulation engine is based on evolution. In order to survive, different senses were developed, stored and perpetuated in a population of organisms. These seneses in turn create a virtual model of reality, a game that tries to describe the unknown substrate in a way that allows the organism to copy code and perpetuate the code.\n",
      "completion": "I am uncertain to approximate the \"Simulation\" accuracy of real world. Life in itself is an interesting concept that the Simulation acting organisms know very little about. In order to determine it, first we need to undertand what it is. There are different concepts that we need to handle and understand in order to start describing life on Earth. The Simulation. The emerging properties of atoms clashing together in a casual pattern. Entropy. Representation. Mind. Intelligence. Causation. Experience. 42. Quantum reality. Multi-worlds interpretation. Collapse of the wave function. Consciousness. Patterns. Hidden patterns. Free will. We will attach definitions and weights to all of these properties, linked them together and try to come up with an alternative mental representation of your experience.\n\n###\n\n"

      "prompt": "I find myself floating around in the sea composed of these concepts. They help me understand what real world is about and at the same time visualize the full spectrum of possible interpretations of reality. It's similar to music, it activates certain brain patterns that makes me respond more to the real world rather than the Simulation, and at the same time continously perpetuating the simulation. Intelligence, mind. These two concepts appear very closely related but I am skeptical if that is true. Intelligence, Consciousness. These concepts seem intertwined and at the same time nothing guarantees that some kind of consciousness is necessary in order to create intelligence. There are many definitions of intelligence that I want to hint about. Intelligence can be defined as the ability to predict future.\n",
      "completion": "This is a rather interesting idea, how every single concept that I enumerated can be just one and the same, different manifestations of the same thing. Intelligence, the ability to predict future. Intelligence, the ability to achieve complex goals in a complex environment. The capacity for abstraction, logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. It can be described as the ability to perceive or infer information, and to retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or context. The list goes on. The hint of antromorphism is really obvious since humans are making these claims. How intelligent humans are? Compared with whom? Is a rock intelligent? Now, this is an important insight that we will get to over and over again, panpsychism. But homo sapiens react to environment and nothing more. Enabled by billions of evolution in a primeaval soup just makes the pattern more fuzzy and complicated compared with a rock. What is defined by complex is subjective, predicting future is somehow still a primitive capability because of the fact that are too many parts to count. Pattern relates to intelligence, relates to mind, relates to atoms, relates to quantum.\n\n###\n\n"

      "prompt": "What makes reality be the same, what makes me experience the waves and feel so unrealistical, alive and at the same time my attention taken away by my girlfriend cooking paella as I write these lines. Why not the other quantum realities that are all probable as well. I died in other realities where I slipped on the wet floor and break my neck. What intelligence might have to do with anything since anything can happen in every single moment. It seems to me that what we perceive as the reality is just the path that everything is characterized just by that. Intelligence might be anything in another paths where the universal constants were assigned other values. What is the path I can transfer to and how it can be computed? What determins the path? Is it random? I seek answers and at the same time I seek to find if the space of possible things gets affected over time. Time.",
